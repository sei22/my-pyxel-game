## Gameplay

- The player is represented by a **small orange square**.
- The maze is **mostly dark**, so the player can only see a limited area around them.
- The player can **place a torch once** using the **Space key**, which permanently lights up part of the maze.
- The maze contains **enemies**. If the player touches an enemy, they die and must restart the level.

The game has **three increasing levels of difficulty**, each introducing new types of enemies:

1. **Level 1**  
   - Enemy 1: Moves **randomly**.

2. **Level 2**  
   - Enemy 1: Moves randomly.  
   - Enemy 2: Turns right.  
   - Enemy 3: **Chases the player**, calculating the path directly to them.

3. **Level 3**  
   - All enemies from previous levels.  
   - Enemy 4: **Spawns directly on the player**, increasing the challenge.
